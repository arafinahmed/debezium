# Debezium Chart README

## Overview

This chart deploys Debezium, a distributed platform for change data capture (CDC). It allows you to stream changes from databases into Kafka topics, enabling real-time data integration.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the Debezium chart, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **PostgreSQL**: 
  - Ensure that PostgreSQL is configured with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and logical replication enabled.
  - Additionally, set `wal_level` to `logical` and `max_wal_senders` to a suitable value to support replication.
  
- **Kafka**: 
  - A Kafka cluster must be running to receive the change events from Debezium.

## SASL Authentication

If your Kafka setup requires SASL authentication, you need to provide the following environment variables in the Debezium configuration:

- `CONNECT_SASL_MECHANISM`: The SASL mechanism to use (e.g., "PLAIN").
- `CONNECT_SECURITY_PROTOCOL`: The security protocol to use (e.g., "SASL_PLAINTEXT").
- `CONNECT_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG`: The JAAS configuration for SASL authentication, which includes the username and password for 
Kafka.
- `CONNECT_PRODUCER_SASL_MECHANISM`: The SASL mechanism for the producer (e.g., "PLAIN").
- `CONNECT_PRODUCER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL`: The security protocol for the producer (e.g., "SASL_PLAINTEXT").
- `CONNECT_PRODUCER_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG`: The JAAS configuration for SASL authentication for the producer.
- `CONNECT_CONSUMER_SASL_MECHANISM`: The SASL mechanism for the consumer (e.g., "PLAIN").
- `CONNECT_CONSUMER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL`: The security protocol for the consumer (e.g., "SASL_PLAINTEXT").
- `CONNECT_CONSUMER_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG`: The JAAS configuration for SASL authentication for the consumer.


### Note

If your Kafka setup does not require SASL authentication, you can omit the above variables from your configuration.

## Deployment

To deploy the Debezium chart, use the following command:


`helm install debezium ./charts/debezium`


Make sure to replace `./charts/debezium` with the actual path to your Debezium chart.

## Connector Configuration and Job Registration

In this setup, the connector configuration is stored inside the container. You can register the connector by running a Kubernetes Job that initializes the connector using a POST request to the Debezium REST API.

### Automatic Registration via Job

To automatically register the connector, you can use the provided Kubernetes Job configuration. This job will wait for Kafka Connect to be ready and then send a POST request to register the connector using the configuration stored in the container.

### Example Job Configuration

Refer to the `job.yaml` file in the Debezium chart for the job configuration. It includes commands to check the readiness of Kafka Connect and to register the connector.

### Manual Registration

Alternatively, you can manually register a connector by sending a POST request to the Debezium REST API. You can use a tool like `curl` to do this. Hereâ€™s an example of how to manually register a connector:

`kubectl exec -it kafka-connect-76d84f95f5-bgz7z -- curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{
      "name": "connector-name",
      "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector", 
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "database.hostname": "postgres-host", 
        "database.port": "5432",
        "database.user": "postgres-user",  
        "database.password": "postgres-password", 
        "database.dbname": "postgres-db", 
        "database.server.name": "postgres-db-server",
        "table.include.list": "public.table-name",  
        "plugin.name": "pgoutput",
        "slot.name": "debezium_table_slot",  
        "publication.name": "debezium_table_pub"
        "topic.prefix": "deb-pg-postgres"
        
      }
    }' http://localhost:8083/connectors`
